<h1> Mariam Gilani </h1>
<p> The similarities between python & scratch is that turtle is  just like the cat in scratch which draws and which is also a library. Int in python is defining things just like if statements and booleans as well as strings in scratch.  Some differences are the lopps where you have to write it all out instead of putting things in boxes.
  Debugging a program gets fustrating because nothing was going  your way, but when you get it to work you feel good about yourself and proud that you did  not give  up </p>
